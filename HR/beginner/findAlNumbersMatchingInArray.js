/*
Basic Set 2.2: Finding all matching numbers in an array
  Given an array of numbers, return all even numbers from the array.
  DO NOT use .filter() in your solution.
  DO use a for loop.
  TRY solving it with non-mutative recursion, only after youâ€™ve solved it using a for loop.
  Examples
    Input	
      numbers:[ 10, 20, 25, 30 ]
    Output
      [ 10, 20, 30 ]
