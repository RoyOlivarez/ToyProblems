/*
  Basic Set 2.1: Finding all matching strings in an array
    Given a length (number) and an array of strings, return all strings that are greater than or equal to the given length.
    DO NOT use .filter() in your solution.
    DO use a for loop.
    TRY solving it with non-mutative recursion, only after youâ€™ve solved it using a for loop.
    Examples
    
      Input
        length:3
        array: [ "a", "ab", "abc", "abcd" ]	
      Output: [ "abc", "abcd" ]
    
      Input
        length:2
        array:[ "x", "hello", "z" ]
      Output: ["hello"]
