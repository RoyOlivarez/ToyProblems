/*
  Basic Set 3.1: Reducing an array of numbers
    Given an array of numbers, return the sum of those numbers.
    DO NOT use numbers.reduce()
    DO use a for loop.
    TRY solving it with non-mutative recursion, only after youâ€™ve solved it using a for loop.
    Examples:
      Input	
        numbers: [ 10, 20, 30 ]	
      
      Output: 60
      Input	
        numbers: []	
      
      Output: 0
