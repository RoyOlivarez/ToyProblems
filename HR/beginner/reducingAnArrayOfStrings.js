/*
  Basic Set 3.2: Reducing an array of strings
    Given an array of strings, return all strings concatenated together.
    DO NOT use strings.reduce() or strings.join('')
    DO use a for loop.
    TRY solving it with non-mutative recursion, only after youâ€™ve solved it using a for loop.
    Examples
      Input	
        strings:[ "a", "b", "c" ]	
      
      Output
        "abc"
      
      Input	
        strings:  [ ]
      Output
        ""
